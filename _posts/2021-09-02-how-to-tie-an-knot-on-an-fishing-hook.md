Hello Hoggerz! This is Fast Freddie to talk to you about tying a knot on a hook. This is one of the most basic things to do when you want to go fishing. Without a line, you can't catch fish. I will go over the basics in tying this knot. For beginners, this is a quick and simple knot for your fishing adventures. For decades, this has been my go-to knot, I call it the "Easy Freddie Knot" You'll be able to tie this in the blindfolded with some practice!

1. Run the tag end of the line through the eye of the hook and pull 8â€“10 inches of line through the hook eye.
2. Then take the tag end an push it through the eye of the hook again until it make a large loop.
3. Take the big loop and wrap it over the other line and pull it right back through the hole.
4. Then pick your hook up and bring it through the same hole.
5. Pull and Tighten the lines slowly.
6. Clip the tag end so that only 1/8-inch is left (A standard fingernail clipper is a great tool for making a clean final cut on the tag end).

**Note:** Instead of clipping the tag end to 1/8 inch, you could leave the remaining tag end about 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch long and then touch the very tip of the tag end to the hot end of a lit cigarette (or a just-blown-out match) in order to create a ball on the end of the line, which prevents the tag end from pulling out under stress.
