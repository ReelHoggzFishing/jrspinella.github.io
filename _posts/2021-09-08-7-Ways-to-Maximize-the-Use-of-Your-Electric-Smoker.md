Hey Hoggerz, John aka SpinMan, here to talk about 7 Ways to Maximize the Use of Your Electric Smoker. I have an Char-Broil Deluxe Digital Electric Smoker and these ways have helped me make the most out of my smoker.

Maybe you've recently purchased an electric smoker. Or you've heard how useful they are and are considering purchasing one for yourself.

You could waste a lot of time looking for tips and tricks on how to get the most out of your new smoker on the internet, but I am sure you'd rather simply get out there and start smoking! To save you time, I've compiled a list of 7 essential recommendations for mastering your electric smoker.

### Don't smoke your food too much.
When it comes to smoking, remember that more isn't always better. In general, it's surprising how little smoke is required to provide excellent flavor.

While there will be some trial and error (which is half the fun, IMO), keep in mind that food that has been over-smoked, particularly fowl, can turn almost inedible.

When cooking chicken, you'll probably just need one tray of chips/pellets to obtain a decent flavor.

### Smoke the chicken on a higher heat setting.
Unlike Ribs or Pork, Chicken isn't a meat that needs to be cooked slowly.

In reality, you should aim for a temperature of roughly 275°F for smoking chicken. Cooking time should be between 12 and 2 hours.

It's especially important to get the flesh cooked properly while cooking chicken. Undercooked chicken is harmful, as you presumably well know.

Checking the interior temperature of the flesh is the best technique to see if the chicken is done. Before it is cooked and safe to eat, the internal temperature must reach 165°F.

Counting the time the chicken has been cooking is not a reliable enough indicator of whether the meat is done.

### Learn how to manage temperature fluctuations.
The temperature inside an electric smoker is known for ‘swinging' at the start of a smoke. This can be up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit above or below the chosen temperature.

Let's take a look at why these swings occur in order to figure out how to control them.

If you set your cooker to a specific temperature, such as 220°F, the temperature will gradually climb until it reaches this level. Once this temperature is reached, the heating element will turn off, but due to a tiny lag, the internal temperature in the cooker will continue to rise on its own for a while.

The rate at which the temperature rises is determined by a number of factors, including the outside temperature and how windy it is.

The temperature will begin to decrease again at some point. The element will turn back on after the temperature has dropped to your desired level. However, until the element's impact kicks in, the temperature will continue to decrease below your target value. This is due to the time difference once again.

As a result, if you desire a temperature of 220°F inside your cooker, set the smoker to 205°F or 210°F.

As the temperature rises, you'll need to keep an eye on it. Reset the temperature on the controller to 220°F once the internal temperature reaches your actual target temperature (220°F), as it increases above the setting you actually selected (210°F).

You will lessen the temperature "swing" by employing this strategy since your cooker will not have to compensate for the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature.

When you were looking at smokes, perhaps you did your research and chose a type that was properly insulated. If you're still on the fence, check out our guide to the finest electric smokers.

To lessen the "swing" even further, you may need to make some fine modifications to the set temperature. After a little experimenting, you should be able to get your smoker running close to temperature right away.

### Control the position of your vents.
When using a charcoal smoker, finding the appropriate vent location can be difficult, but when using an electric smoker, it's not nearly as difficult.

When applying smoke to your meat, it's recommended to leave the vent fully open as a matter of thumb. You may avoid creosote buildup on your meat by leaving the vent totally open.

Creosote is a smoke-derived chemical that, in small doses, contributes to the unique smokey flavor we all enjoy. It can, however, swiftly escalate into a very terrible situation. While a small bit of creosote in your smoke is beneficial, a creosote layer on your food will ruin the flavor.

In most cases, the only time you should close your vent during cooking is when you've done smoking your meat and want to simply boost the internal temperature of the smoker.

### Clean up will be much easier if you use foil on your grill racks.
This is more of a suggestion, but let's face it, any advice that reduces cleanup time is great.

Clean grill racks equal better barbeque outcomes, aside from being more efficient.

Grease and oil left on your grates will get rancid. When grease and oil are hot when cooking, they can attach to your food and cause smoke. What's the end result? It will ruin the flavor of your dish.

You can also cover your heat deflector pan and drip pan with foil.

### Don't soak your wood chips in water or any liquid.
You may want to produce your smoke with chips, and that is absolutely up to you — I will not judge you.

However, if you do opt to use chips, there's no need to soak them first.

What is the explanation for this? The white "smoke" that emerges from these soaking chips isn't smoke at all it is excactly steam.

When smoking, the goal is to produce thin, blue smoke. This is the kind of smoke that gives us that delicious, smoky flavor we're all looking for.

As all that moisture evaporates from your chips, white, billowy vapour can make temperature management more difficult.

It also has the potential to corrode your smoker's components.

### Before using your smoker for the first time, Pre-heat it.
It may appear like pre-heating your smoker before using it is a major pain in the neck. But believe me when I say that there are compelling reasons to do so.

To begin with, it will ensure that any foul residue left over from the manufacturing process is removed before you use your smoker to cook meals. I am talking about petroleum-based goods, solvents, and dust here.

The fine layer of smoke that coats everything inside your smoker in a black coating not only helps cure and seal the inside, but it also contributes to the smokey flavor of whatever you cook whcih is even more reasons why it's crucial.
