Hey Hoggerz, John aka SpinMan, here to talk about my experience and give a product review on my Charbroil Deluxe smoker. 

What I have been seeing, electric smoker is a lucrative niche in the equipment industry for a number of reasons. They're also good as an beginners introduction to smoking meats, in my opinion, and that's how I approached this endeavor. I am going to answer the basic question... Is it worth it?

If you are handy with building things, you can build your own smoker with a few parts. The most cost-effective method of smoking is to use a metal container for the heat and a tube to capture the smoke that surrounds the meal. You'll need a dead fridge, an old filing cabinet, and a robust wood box, as well as metal ducting to put it all together. Light a fire, add wood as needed, and do it all over again. 

### So, Why did I get an Electric Smoker?
I did not want to go down that route, I have an Char-Broil Deluxe Digital Electric Smoker. Alot of people are familiar with Char-Broil and think highly of them because they produce high-quality items and have a nearly 75-year track record. if you want to get started in smoking meat, I put a link to my beginners smoker kit below or you can [click here]("https://kit.co/reelhoggzfishing/smoking-kit").

I have been using this smoker for about 6 months. I have smoke pork butt, ribs, chicken and an a flat briskett. I wanted to start smoking meat without the cost or the time involved with more expensive smokers.

#### Let's start with the Advantages
The first advantage of this device is that they use real wood, either in the form of chips or small chunks. Using full chunk split hardwood and fruit woods or coarse sawdust, you can get results that are closer to those of a pro. I have nothing against pellets, they have their own set of appealing advantages, but you get to use a natural, consistent product with usig natural wood.

Next advantage is easy digital controls, this is a plus as I do not need to keep a extra temp gauge to understand what the internal temp of the smokers is. I like the digital controls' approach, as well as the fact that there's a built-in food thermometer that works with your cooking conditions. You can program the smokeer to respond to the internal temperature of your meat, for example, and the smoker will decrease to a holding temperature of 120 degrees once that temperature is met.  

Final advantage is solid build, It has a strong latch clasp and a glass door. Another mixed blessing is glass. It's just another thing to clean, and it's not actually necessary for a cooking procedure that takes hours. The unit as a whole is nicely insulated and feels solid. All in all, the parts seems to be put togther well.

#### Ok the Disadvantages
For starters, unless you have a stable heat resistant raised platform for the device which I did not, I prefer legs on the smoker. This unit does not have legs, but it does come with a base stand, which puts it near the top of the price range for the smokers we're looking at. Which I bought base stand on Amazon here.

Another, you get four shelves and four fixed brackets to utilize the shelves on. You don't have much flexibility if you want to smoke a 20lb pork butt, however since the dimensions of this smoker is with over 700 square inches, you can leave shelves out and you could smoke a large meat.

One more but this a small disadvantage with digital controls, becuase this is complicated by two things. First, the temperature monitoring system's accuracy in the smoker; I discovered some inconsistencies. I have seen that if I set the temp at 225, there are times on a hot day, the temp raises higher than 250 degrees. Second, the only thing you can see in this mode is the current meat temperature and the desired temperature. It does not display the temperature of the chamber. As a result, I am putting your faith in the smoker to provide me with a low-and-slow cooking experience.

#### The Question: Is it worth it?
For what I use this for and what I look to smoke. I think this is worth buying for the weekend smoker. Who is not looking to do compentions but wants to have good smoke meat to enjoy with friends and family. Do you have any more suggestions, or do you have any questions that I didn't address in this article? Please write a comment in the space provided below.
