Hey there Hoggerz! Fast Freddie here again. I am continuing this series of posts on fishing knots. These knots are good for beginners and advanced anglers. 

There are alot o dang knots, thousands of them. Fortunately for you anglers, just a few are required for our needs. You should try to have at least 8 to 10 knotsÂ in your repertoire, but if you only have time to learn 5 of them, these are the ones I'd pick. Everybody has a favorites. Your top five may differ significantly from mine, but at least two or three of the following you should learn.

## Fisherman's Knot

The name gives it away, and it occasionally gets a bad rap when compared to more intricate knots; yet, every angler knows it, or should know it, because it is by far the most popular knot for connecting hook and line. It's also as simple to knot as it is to describe. Double back on the main line after threading 2 or 3 inches of line through the eye of the hook. 

Spin the hook five or six times, holding both the main line and the tag end, to wrap the tag end around the main line. The tag end should now be threaded through the loop produced above the hook eye. After that, tighten the tag end by passing it back through the wider loop made by passing it through the eye. The enhanced clinch knot or half blood knot are other names for the fisherman's knot.

## Blood Knot

Whether you're linking a 5x tippet to a floating fly line, braided backing to mono, or a 200-pound Flourocarbon leader to a 300-pound monofilament topshot, this is one of the easiest and most popular knots for tying two lines together. Essentially, you're tying two fisherman's knots in opposite directions, with a loop in the middle that acts as a fishhook eye.

It's a good idea to lube the knot before cinching it firmly once you've finished your wind. After that, the snip of the tag comes to an end.

## Palomar Knot

For a moment, let's return to tying the hook to the line, because the fisherman's knot isn't the only option. The Palomar is preferred by some. Make a 4-6 inch loop in your line and thread it through your hook's eye. With the double line, tie an overhand knot. Cinch tight after passing the hook through the loop.

## Surgeon's Loop Knot

It was difficult to choose which of the remaining knots to close off my top 5, but I eventually settled on the loop knot for several reasons. One is that practically all of the other solutions serve the same purpose as one of the previously mentioned. The Surgeon's Loop, often known as the Loop Knot, is a unique knot. The knot cinches well above the eye, allowing a hook or lure to move freely below it, preventing the knot from depressing lure action. This makes it a far better choice for tying on plugs or spoons in situations where motion is crucial.

## Snelling a Hook

This is a really useful ability to have, especially as you go to more complicated rigs with several hooks or additional attachments such as droppers or sinkers. It's also simple to tie. Pass your line's tag end through the eye of the hook twice. Make a loop that is slightly larger than the hook and hangs beside it as you go. Wrap that loop 8 to 10 times around the hook, making tight coils on the shank. Pull the line until the loop is taught under the coils while holding the coils in place with one finger.
