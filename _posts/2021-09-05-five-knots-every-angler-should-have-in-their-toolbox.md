Hey Hoggerz! Fast Freddie here again. I am continuing this series of posts on knots. 

There are alot o dang knots, thousands of them. Fortunately for you anglers, just a few are required for our needs. You should try to have at least 8 to 10 knotsÂ in your repertoire, but if you only have time to learn 5 of them, these are the ones I'd pick. Everybody has a favorites. Your top five may differ significantly from mine, but at least two or three of the following you should learn.

## Fisherman's Knot

The name gives it away, and it occasionally gets a bad rap when compared to more intricate knots; yet, every angler knows it, or should know it, because it is by far the most popular knot for connecting hook and line. It's also as simple to knot as it is to describe. Double back on the main line after threading 2 or 3 inches of line through the eye of the hook. 

Spin the hook five or six times, holding both the main line and the tag end, to wrap the tag end around the main line. The tag end should now be threaded through the loop produced above the hook eye. After that, tighten the tag end by passing it back through the wider loop made by passing it through the eye. The enhanced clinch knot or half blood knot are other names for the fisherman's knot. 

Take a look at the picture to get a better understanding:
